                        <p>A HASH is usually a cryptographic procedure which is used to uniquely describe the contents of a file. Any change in the content of the original file automatically results in a complete change of the HASH code. It is virtually

                        </p>

                        <p>If the servers are reachable but no suitable transactions can be found (possibly manually and not in our validation area), then a final check of the stored PRIVATEKEYS or HASHES in the blockchains cannot take place. The proof of

                            be used due to the delay for each full week. The liability for default is limited to a total of 5% of the total price of the respective order. This shall not apply if the default is due to gross negligence or intent on the

                        <p>3.4 &nbsp; In the event of a delay in performance, the customer shall only be entitled to withdraw from the contract under statutory provisions if the delay is attributable to the Contractor. If the customer asserts justified claims
                            for damages or reimbursement of expenses in lieu of performance due to the delay, he shall be entitled to demand 1% of the price for each full week of the delay for that part of the performance which cannot be used due to the
                            delay, however, in total no more than 10% of the total price of the respective order. Section 3.3 sentence 3 applies accordingly.

                        <p>All other rights shall remain with the Contractor. If any rights of use are granted to the customer, these shall only be granted provisionally until the due remuneration has been paid and shall be freely revocable by the Contractor.
                            If the Contractor revokes the right of use, this shall only constitute a withdrawal from or termination of the contract if the Contractor expressly declares this to be the case.</p>

                        <p>7.3 &nbsp; The Contractor may revoke the customer's usage right if the customer materially violates usage restrictions or other provisions for protection against unauthorised use. Such revocation requires a written notice of revocation;

                        <p>11.2 &nbsp;The Contractor shall be liable for slight negligence if he or his legal representatives or agents have breached a material contractual obligation (so-called cardinal obligation), the fulfilment of which is essential
                            for the proper execution of the contract, or the breach of which endangers the achievement of the purpose of the contract and on the observance of which the customer may usually rely.</p>
                        <p>Otherwise, liability for slight negligence shall be excluded. Liability according to Section 11.1 remains unaffected by this paragraph.</p>
                        <p>Where the Contractor is liable for slight negligence, the liability for property damage and financial losses shall be limited to the foreseeable damage typical for the contract. Liability for any other, remote consequential damages

                        <p>11.3 &nbsp; Section 10.5 shall apply accordingly regarding the statute of limitations.</p>
                        <p>11.4 &nbsp;If any loss of data occurs, the Contractor shall only be liable for the expenditure required to restore the data if proper data backup would have been maintained by the customer. In the event of slight negligence on
                            the part of the Contractor, such liability shall only apply if the customer has carried out a proper data backup immediately before the action leading to the loss of data.</p>
